# solutions-The-C-Programming-Language


This respository is about my solutions to most programming problems
in "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M.
 Ritchie (K&R).

I do this to show my respect to Kernighan and Ritchie. In fact, I
really appreciate those great changes brought by C. I will take C
as my part-time job and would like to contribute to some open source
C projects later.

This project under the MIT Lisense.
